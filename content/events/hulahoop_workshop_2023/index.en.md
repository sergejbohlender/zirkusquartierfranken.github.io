## Schedule

{{< timeline >}}
{{< timelineItem icon="star" header="Hoop Body Space" subheader="Day 1" >}}
This first day explores a use of space and movement with hoop manipulation. We’ll see how these tools can lead us to improvisational movement and to highlight our flow and stage presence. 
{{< /timelineItem >}}
{{< timelineItem icon="star" header="Hoop technics" subheader="Day 2" >}}
We will go through off body exploration (balance, coinflip, bounce), 2 hoops exploration (horizontal - vertical flow) and 3 hoops exploration (Bramson rolls and other stuff). The goal will be to discover news tricks, or variations to yours and off course kipping in mind the work on movement to practice them. 
{{< /timelineItem >}}
{{< timelineItem icon="star" header="Collective work - Solo work" subheader="Day 3" >}}
A first part we’ll be dedicated to a collective work research, what can we do with several bodies and few hoops? How can we move, juggle, manipulate objects in a small group? We will use movement and technics we learned together and some juggling to create together In a second part, we’ll see how can we integrate the work of day 1 and day 2 into short solo sequences that contain the nature of the work on movement.
